# üöÄ Machine Learning Algorithms Hub

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Algorithms Hub**! This repository provides a comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithms for **Classification** and **Regression** tasks, along with robust tools for **Data Preprocessing**.

Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this repo is your go-to resource to explore the fundamentals and applications of machine learning algorithms. Let's dive in!

---

## üìÇ Repository Overview

This repo is organized into three main categories: **Classification**, **Data Preprocessing**, and **Regression**. Each folder contains easy-to-understand implementations of popular algorithms, ready for you to explore, train, and apply to your datasets.

---

### üèÜ **Classification Algorithms**

Perfect for solving classification problems, these algorithms will help you classify data into distinct categories:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**: A simple, yet powerful, algorithm that classifies data based on its nearest neighbors.
* **Logistic Regression**: A model used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of a categorical outcome.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A versatile algorithm ideal for high-dimensional data, helping to find the optimal boundary between classes.

### üßπ **Data Preprocessing Tools**

Before training your models, it's important to clean and prepare your data. In this folder, you'll find:

* **Data.csv**: The dataset used in training and testing the models. You can replace this with your own dataset.
* **data\_preprocessing\_template.py**: A template script for standard data preprocessing tasks (handling missing values, encoding, etc.).
* **data\_preprocessing\_tools.py**: A collection of useful functions to help clean and prepare the data for modeling.
* **data\_preprocessing\_tools.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook version for hands-on, interactive preprocessing.

### üìâ **Regression Algorithms**

For predicting continuous numerical values, these regression algorithms are your tools of choice:

* **Decision Tree Regression**: Non-linear regression that models data with decision trees.
* **Multiple Linear Regression**: A statistical approach to modeling the relationship between several features and a dependent variable.
* **Polynomial Regression**: Extension of linear regression that fits the data to a polynomial curve.
* **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for better accuracy.
* **Simple Linear Regression**: A basic yet effective model that captures the relationship between two variables.
* **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Uses support vector machines for regression, suitable for high-dimensional datasets.

## üõ† Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with this repository, you'll need:

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clone the Repo**

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ml-algorithms.git
cd ml-algorithms
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Dependencies**

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Preprocessing**

Before you jump into training your models, you‚Äôll need to preprocess your data:

* Open `data_preprocessing_template.py` or the Jupyter notebook `data_preprocessing_tools.ipynb`.
* Modify the script to clean your data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Train Your Model**

Choose an algorithm from the **Classification** or **Regression** folders and run the corresponding Python script:

```bash
python classification/k_nearest_neighbors.py
```

* Follow the script's instructions to train and evaluate your model.
