## üìÇ Repository Overview

This repo is organized into three main categories: **Classification**, **Data Preprocessing**, and **Regression**. Each folder contains easy-to-understand implementations of popular algorithms, ready for you to explore, train, and apply to your datasets.

### üèÜ **Classification Algorithms**

Perfect for solving classification problems, these algorithms will help you classify data into distinct categories:

* **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**: A simple, yet powerful, algorithm that classifies data based on its nearest neighbors.
* **Logistic Regression**: A model used for binary classification problems, predicting the probability of a categorical outcome.
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A versatile algorithm ideal for high-dimensional data, helping to find the optimal boundary between classes.

### üßπ **Data Preprocessing Tools**

Before training your models, it's important to clean and prepare your data. In this folder, you'll find:

* **Data.csv**: The dataset used in training and testing the models. You can replace this with your own dataset.
* **data\_preprocessing\_template.py**: A template script for standard data preprocessing tasks (handling missing values, encoding, etc.).
* **data\_preprocessing\_tools.py**: A collection of useful functions to help clean and prepare the data for modeling.
* **data\_preprocessing\_tools.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook version for hands-on, interactive preprocessing.
